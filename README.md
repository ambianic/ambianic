# Project mission
  
[Ambianic.ai](https://ambianic.ai) is an Open Source Ambient Intelligence platform for Home and Business Automation

[Ambianic Edge](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-edge) runs on edge devices such as Raspberry Pi. It monitors sensors, cameras and other inputs, passes them through AI inference and makes actionable observations.

[Ambianic UI](https://github.com/ambianic/ambianic-ui) is the user interface to Ambianic Edge deployments. Latest live version available at [ui.ambianic.ai](https://ui.ambianic.ai)

Following is a conceptual flow diagram:
